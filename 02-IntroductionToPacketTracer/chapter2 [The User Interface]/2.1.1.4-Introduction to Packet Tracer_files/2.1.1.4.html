        <h1>Packet Tracer - GUI and CLI Configuration</h1>
        <div>
          <p>For intermediate devices such as routers and switches, there are two methods of configuration available. Devices can be configured or investigated via a Config tab (a GUI interface) or a command line interface (CLI) (Figure 1). The Config tab does not exist in most physical equipment. This tab is a learning tab in Packet Tracer. If you don’t know how to use the command line interface, this tab provides a way to “fill in the blank” to do basic configurations. It will show the equivalent CLI commands that would do the same thing if using the Command Line Interface. The CLI interface requires knowledge of device configuration.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For some of the end devices, such as PCs and laptops, Packet Tracer provides a desktop interface that gives you access to IP configuration, wireless configuration, a command prompt, a Web browser, and much more (Figure 2).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If you are configuring a server, the server has all of the functions of the Host with the addition of one more tab, the services tab (Figure 3). This tab allows a server to be configured as a web server, a DHCP server, a DNS server, or various other servers visible in the graphic. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows the four tabs that appear when a packet tracer device is clicked. The tabs are physical, config, C L I, and attributes. The physical tab is selected and on the left side is a box that says modules. To the right of it is the physical device view with the options: zoom in, original size, and zoom out. A close up of the switch shows some of the switch ports. Figure 2 shows the desktop tab with the following options on the top row: I P configuration, command prompt, traffic generator, text editor and web browser. The second row options are P P P o E dialer, V P N, triple A accounting, firewall, and I P v 6 firewall. The last row of icons are netflow collector, I o E monitor and I o E I D E. Figure 3 shows the services tab. The services listed down the left side are H T T P, D H C p, d h c p v 6, t f t p, d n s sys log, triple A, n t p, e mail, f t p, I o t, and V M management. To the right of the list are the http options. H t t p on radio button is selected. The other option is off. H t t p s is selected. Within the file manager table are three columns – file name, edit, and deleted. There are five file names in the file name columne. In the edit column for all the five files is the word ( edit ). In the delete column for all five files is the word ( delete ). The options at the bottom are new file and import.</div>
