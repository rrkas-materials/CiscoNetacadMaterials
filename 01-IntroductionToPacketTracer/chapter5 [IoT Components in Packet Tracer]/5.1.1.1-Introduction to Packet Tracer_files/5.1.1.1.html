        <h1>Configure IoT Devices using Packet Tracer.</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Packet Tracer has a wide variety of sensors and smart devices that will allow you to design smart homes, smart cities, smart factories, and smart power grids. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To locate the available sensors and smart devices, select End Devices from the Device Selection box at the lower left-hand side of the screen. Next select one of the subcategories such as Home. In the Home subcategory, you will see many IoT devices such as an air conditioner, ceiling fan, coffee maker, and CO detector. These devices can be connected to your network wirelessly or with a physical cable.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To connect the devices to your network, you need a device, such as a home gateway or registration server. To find a home gateway, select Network Devices from the Device Selection box and then select Wireless Devices from the subcategories.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To control the devices, you have two options: </p>
          <p>1. You can interact directly with a device. Hold down the Alt key and at the same time click on the device to turn it on or off.</p>
          <p>2. You can connect remotely over the network. Using a remote PC, tablet or smart phone, you can use a web browser to connect to the home gateway or registration server. From here, you can turn the devices on or off using the features of the home gateway or registration server.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To configure devices, click on the device to open it. Once opened, you have a multiple tabs to select:</p>
          <p>• Specifications – describes the features, usage, local and remote control of the device</p>
          <p>• Physical – available modules and power connections</p>
          <p>• Config – shows display name, serial number, network configuration, and IoT server</p>
          <p>• Attributes – display the device attributes such as MTBF, power consumption, and cost</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To configuration the home gateway, you click on the device. Within the device you have multiple tabs to select.</p>
          <p>• Physical – available modules, and power</p>
          <p>• Config – shows display name, interfaces (Internet, LAN, and wireless) to be configured</p>
          <p>• GUI – shows services to be turned on/off</p>
          <p>• Attributes – shows features and values related to device such as: mean time between failure (MTBF), cost, power sources, and wattage</p>
          <p></p>
