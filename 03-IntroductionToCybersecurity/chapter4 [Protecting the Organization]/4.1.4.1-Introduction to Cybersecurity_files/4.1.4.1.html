          <p>How do you provide defense against the constant presence of zero-day attacks, as well as advanced persistent threats (APT) that steal data over long periods of time? One solution is to use an enterprise-level advanced malware detection solution that offers real-time malware detection. </p>
          <p>Network administrators must constantly monitor the network for signs of malware or behaviors that reveal the presence of an APT. Cisco has an Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) Threat Grid that analyzes millions of files and correlates them against hundreds of millions of other analyzed malware artifacts. This provides a global view of malware attacks, campaigns, and their distribution. AMP is client/server software deployed on host endpoints, as a standalone server, or on other network security devices. The figure shows the benefits of the AMP Threat Grid.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">The figure on this page is titled AMP threat grid benefits. Cisco AMP threat grid benefits security functions across the organization. The benefits are: 1. secure operations center team: get more accurate, actionable data 2. Incidence response team: use forensically sound information to understand suspicious behavior faster 3. Threat intelligence team: proactively improve security infrastructure 4. Security infrastructure engineering team: Consume and act on threat information faster, and in an automated manner.</div>
