        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Software is not perfect. When a hacker exploits a flaw in a piece of software before the creator can fix it, it is known as a zero-day attack. Due to the sophistication and enormity of zero-day attacks found today, it is becoming common that network attacks will succeed and that a successful defense is now measured in how quickly a network can respond to an attack. The ability to detect attacks as they happen in real-time, as well as stopping the attacks immediately, or within minutes of occurring, is the ideal goal. Unfortunately, many companies and organizations today are unable to detect attacks until days or even months after they have occurred.</p>

                <b>Real Time Scanning from Edge to Endpoint </b>- Detecting attacks in real time requires actively scanning for attacks using firewall and IDS/IPS network devices. Next generation client/server malware detection with connections to online global threat centers must also be used. Today, active scanning devices and software must detect network anomalies using context-based analysis and behavior detection.</li>

                <b>DDoS Attacks and Real Time Response </b>- DDoS is one of the biggest attack threats requiring real-time response and detection. DDoS attacks are extremely difficult to defend against because the attacks originate from hundreds, or thousands of zombie hosts, and the attacks appear as legitimate traffic, as shown in the figure. For many companies and organizations, regularly occurring DDoS attacks cripple Internet servers and network availability. The ability to detect and respond to DDoS attacks in real-time is crucial.</li>
