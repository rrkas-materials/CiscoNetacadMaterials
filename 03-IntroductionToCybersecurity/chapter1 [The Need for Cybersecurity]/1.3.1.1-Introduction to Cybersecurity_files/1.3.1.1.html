        <h1 tabindex="0">Types of Attackers</h1>
        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Attackers are individuals or groups who attempt to exploit vulnerability for personal or financial gain. Attackers are interested in everything, from credit cards to product designs and anything with value.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Amateurs</b> – These people are sometimes called Script Kiddies. They are usually attackers with little or no skill, often using existing tools or instructions found on the Internet to launch attacks. Some of them are just curious, while others are trying to demonstrate their skills and cause harm. They may be using basic tools, but the results can still be devastating.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Hackers</b> – This group of attackers break into computers or networks to gain access. Depending on the intent of the break-in, these attackers are classified as white, gray, or black hats. The white hat attackers break into networks or computer systems to discover weaknesses so that the security of these systems can be improved. These break-ins are done with prior permission and any results are reported back to the owner. On the other hand, black hat attackers take advantage of any vulnerability for illegal personal, financial or political gain. Gray hat attackers are somewhere between white and black hat attackers. The gray hat attackers may find a vulnerability in a system. Gray hat hackers may report the vulnerability to the owners of the system if that action coincides with their agenda. Some gray hat hackers publish the facts about the vulnerability on the Internet so that other attackers can exploit it.</p>
          <p>The figure gives details about the terms white hat hacker, black hat hacker, and gray hat hacker.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Organized Hackers</b> – These hackers include organizations of cyber criminals, hacktivists, terrorists, and state-sponsored hackers. Cyber criminals are usually groups of professional criminals focused on control, power, and wealth. The criminals are highly sophisticated and organized, and they may even provide cybercrime as a service to other criminals. Hacktivists make political statements to create awareness to issues that are important to them. State-sponsored attackers gather intelligence or commit sabotage on behalf of their government. These attackers are usually highly trained and well-funded, and their attacks are focused on specific goals that are beneficial to their government.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">The figure describes White, Grey and Black Hat hackers. White hat hacker: These are ethical hackers who use their programming skills for good, ethical, and legal purposes White hat hackers may perform network penetration test in an attempt to compromise networks and systems by using their knowledge of computer security system to discover network vulnerabilities. Security vulnerabilities are reported to developers for them to fix before the vulnerabilities can be threatened. Some organizations award prizes or bounties to white hat hackers when they inform them of a vulnerability. Grey hat hackers: These are individuals who commit crimes and do arguably unethical things, but not for personal gain or to cause damage. An example would be someone who compromises a network without permission and then discloses the vulnerability publicly. A grey hat hacker may disclose a vulnerability to the affected organization after having compromised their network. This allows the organization to fix the problem. Black hat hackers: These are unethical criminals who violate computer and network security for personal gain, or for malicious reasons such as attacking networks. Black hat hackers exploit vulnerabilities to compromise computer and network systems.</div>
