            <b>Viruses</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A virus is malicious executable code attached to another executable file, such as a legitimate program. Most viruses require end-user initiation, and can activate at a specific time or date. Computer viruses usually spread in one of three ways: from removable media; from downloads off the Internet; and from email attachments. Viruses can be harmless and simply display a picture or they can be destructive, such as those that modify or delete data. In order to avoid detection, a virus mutates. The simple act of opening a file can trigger a virus. A boot sector, or file system virus, infects USB flash drives and can spread to the system’s hard disk. Executing a specific program can activate a program virus. Once the program virus is active, it will usually infect other programs on the computer or other computers on the network. The Melissa Virus was an example of a virus spread via email. Melissa affected tens of thousands of users and caused an estimated $1.2 billion in damage.

          <p>
            <b>Worms</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Worms are malicious code that replicates by independently exploiting vulnerabilities in networks. Worms usually slow down networks. Whereas a virus requires a host program to run, worms can run by themselves. Other than the initial infection, worms no longer require user participation. After a worm affects a host, it is able to spread very quickly over the network. Worms share similar patterns. They all have an enabling vulnerability, a way to propagate themselves, and they all contain a payload.</p>
          <p>Worms are responsible for some of the most devastating attacks on the Internet. For example, in 2001, the Code Red worm infected 658 servers. Within 19 hours, the worm infected over 300,000 servers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Trojan horse</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A Trojan horse is malware that carries out malicious operations under the guise of a desired operation such as playing an online game. This malicious code exploits the privileges of the user that runs it. A Trojan horse differs from a virus because the Trojan binds itself to non-executable files, such as image files, audio files, or games.</p>
