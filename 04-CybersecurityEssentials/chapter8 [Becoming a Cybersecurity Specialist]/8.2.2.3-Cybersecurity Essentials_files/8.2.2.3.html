        <h1 tabindex="0">Industry-Specific Laws</h1>
        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Many industry specific laws have a security and/or a privacy component. The U.S. government requires compliance from organizations within these industries. Cybersecurity specialists must be able to translate the legal requirements into security policies and practices.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act is a piece of legislation that mainly affects the financial industry. A portion of that legislation, though, includes privacy provisions for individuals. The provision provides for opt-out methods so that individuals can control the use of information provided in a business transaction with an organization that is part of the financial institution. The GLBA restricts information sharing with third-party firms. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Following several high-profile corporate accounting scandals in the U.S., congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX).The purpose of SOX was to overhaul financial and corporate accounting standards and specifically targeted the standards of publicly traded firms in the United States.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Private industry also recognizes how important uniform and enforceable standards are. A Security Standards Council composed of the top corporations in the payment card industry designed a private sector initiative to improve the confidentiality of network communications.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of contractual rules governing how to protect credit card data as merchants and banks exchange the transaction. The PCI DSS is a voluntary standard (in theory) and merchants/vendors can choose whether they wish to abide by the standard. However, vendor noncompliance may result in significantly higher transaction fees, fines up to $500,000, and possibly even the loss of the ability to process credit cards.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Import/Export Encryption Restrictions</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Since World War II, the United States has regulated the export of cryptography due to national security considerations. The Bureau of Industry and Security in the Department of Commerce now controls non-military cryptography exports. There are still export restrictions to rogue states and terrorist organizations.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Countries may decide to restrict the import of cryptography technologies for the following reasons:</p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>The technology may contain a backdoor or security vulnerability.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Citizens can anonymously communicate and avoid any monitoring.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Cryptography may increase levels of privacy above an acceptable level.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
