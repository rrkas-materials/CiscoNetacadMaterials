          <p>There are many applications for both symmetric and asymmetric algorithms.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A one-time password-generating token is a hardware device that uses cryptography to generate a one-time password. A one-time password is an automatically generated numeric or alphanumeric string of characters that authenticates a user for one transaction of one session only. The number changes every 30 seconds or so. The session password appears on a display and the user enters the password.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The electronic payment industry uses 3DES. Operating systems use DES to protect user files and system data with passwords. Most encrypting file systems, such as NTFS, use AES.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Four protocols use asymmetric key algorithms:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Internet Key Exchange (IKE), which is a fundamental component of IPsec Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Secure Socket Layer (SSL), which is a means of implementing cryptography into a web browser.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Secure Shell (SSH), which is a protocol that provides a secure remote access connection to network devices.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), which is a computer program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication to increase the security of email communications.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>A VPN is a private network that uses a public network, usually the Internet, to create a secure communication channel. A VPN connects two endpoints such as two remote offices over the Internet to form the connection.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>VPNs use IPsec. IPsec is a suite of protocols developed to achieve secure services over networks. IPsec services allow for authentication, integrity, access control, and confidentiality. With IPsec, remote sites can exchange encrypted and verified information. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Data in use is a growing concern to many organizations. When in use, data no longer has any protection because the user needs to open and change the data. System memory holds data in use and it can contain sensitive data such as the encryption key. If criminals compromise data in use, they will have access to data at rest and data in motion.</p>
