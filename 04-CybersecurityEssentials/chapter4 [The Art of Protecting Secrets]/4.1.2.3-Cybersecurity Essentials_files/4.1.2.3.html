        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Numerous encryption systems use symmetric encryption. Some of the common encryption standards that use symmetric encryption include the following:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>3DES (Triple DES):</b> Digital Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric block cipher with 64-bit block size that uses a 56-bit key. It takes a 64-bit block of plaintext as input and outputs a 64-bit block of ciphertext. It always operates on blocks of equal size and it uses both permutations and substitutions in the algorithm. A permutation is a way of arranging all elements of a set.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Triple DES encrypts data three times and uses a different key for at least one of the three passes, giving it a cumulative key size of 112-168 bits. 3DES is resistant to attack, but it is much slower than DES.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The 3DES encryption cycle is as follows:</p>
          <p>1. Data encrypted by first DES</p>
          <p>2. Data decrypted by second DES</p>
          <p>3. Data re-encrypted by third DES</p>
          <p>The reverse process decrypts the ciphertext.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>IDEA:</b> The International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) uses 64-bit blocks and 128-bit keys. IDEA performs eight rounds of transformations on each of the 16 blocks that results from dividing each 64-bit block. IDEA was the replacement for DES, and now PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) uses it. PGP is a program that provides privacy and authentication for data communication. GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) is a licensed, free version of PGP.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>AES:</b> The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) has a fixed block size of 128-bits with a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) approved the AES algorithm in December 2001. The U.S. government uses AES to protect classified information. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>AES is a strong algorithm that uses longer key lengths. AES is faster than DES and 3DES, so it provides both a solution for software applications as well as hardware use in firewalls and routers. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Other block ciphers include Skipjack (developed by the NSA), Blowfish, and Twofish.</p>
