        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>It is important to understand the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods. Symmetric encryption systems are more efficient and can handle more data. However, key management with symmetric encryption systems is more problematic and harder to manage. Asymmetric cryptography is more efficient at protecting the confidentiality of small amounts of data, and its size and speed make it more secure for tasks such as electronic key exchange which is a small amount of data rather than encrypting large blocks of data.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Maintaining confidentiality is important for both data at rest and data in motion. In both cases, symmetric encryption is favored because of its speed and the simplicity of the algorithm. Some asymmetric algorithms can significantly increase the size of the object encrypted. Therefore, in the case of data in motion, use public key cryptography to exchange the secret key, and then symmetric cryptography to ensure the confidentiality of the data sent.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">Symmetric Encryption algorithms are known as shared-secret key algorithms. The usual key length is 80 to 256 bits. A sender and receiver must share a secret key. Algorithms are usually quite fast (wire speed) because they are based on simple mathematical operations. Examples include DES, 2DES, AES, IDEA, RC2/4/5/6, and Blowfish. Asymmetric encryption algorithms are known as public key algorithms. The ususal key length is 512 to 4,096 bits. A sender and receiver do not share a secret key. Algorithms are relatively slow because they are based on difficult computational algorithms. Examples include RSA, ElGamal, elliptic curves, and Diffie Helman.</div>
