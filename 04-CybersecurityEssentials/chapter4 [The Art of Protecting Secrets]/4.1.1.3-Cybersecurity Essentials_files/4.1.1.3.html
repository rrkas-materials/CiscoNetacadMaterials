        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Each encryption method uses a specific algorithm, called a cipher, to encrypt and decrypt messages. A cipher is a series of well-defined steps used to encrypt and decrypt messages. There are several methods of creating ciphertext:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Transposition – letters are rearranged (Figure 1)</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Substitution – letters are replaced (Figure 2)</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>One-time pad – plaintext combined with a secret key creates a new character, which then combines with the plaintext to produce ciphertext (Figure 3)</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>Old encryption algorithms, such as the Caesar cipher or the Enigma machine, depended on the secrecy of the algorithm to achieve confidentiality. With modern technology, where reverse engineering is often simple, parties use public-domain algorithms. With most modern algorithms, successful decryption requires knowledge of the appropriate cryptographic keys. This means that the security of encryption lies in the secrecy of the keys, not the algorithm.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Some modern encryption algorithms still use transposition as part of the algorithm.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Key management is the most difficult part of designing a cryptosystem. Many cryptosystems have failed because of mistakes in their key management, and all modern cryptographic algorithms require key management procedures. In practice, most attacks on cryptographic systems involve attacking the key management system, rather than the cryptographic algorithm itself.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0"> There are three figures on this page. Figure 1 titled transposition ciphers depicts three scrolls. The top scroll is titled a plaintext message with two lines of text: Line 1: FLANK EAST. Line 2: ATTACK AT DAWN. The middle scroll is titled Rail Fence Cipher (using a key of 3) showing three lines of text with random letters that are connected with diagonal lines. The bottom scroll is titled ciphertext with three lines of text: line 1: FKTATN, line 2: LNESATCADW, line 3: AATKA. Figure 2 is titled substitution ciphers depicts three scrolls. The first scroll is titled a plaintext message with two lines of text: Line 1: FLANK EAST. Line 2: ATTACK AT DAWN. The two scrolls in the middle section together is titled shift the top scroll by three characters (key of 3) displaying two scrolls of text: top scroll: . . . A B C D E F G H I J K L bottom scroll: A B C D E F G H I J K L M. The letter A from the top scroll is matched with the letter D in the bottom scroll. The letter B from the top scroll is matched with the letter E in the bottom scroll. The letter C from the top scroll is matched with the letter F in the bottom scroll. The last scroll is titled ciphertext with a line of text: I O D Q N  H D V W  D W W D F N  D W  G D Z Q. Figure 3 is titled one-time pad. This figure displays a Plaintext document and a secret key equals one-time pad in the first line. The second line displays the One-time pad and plaintext document equals the encrypted text.</div>
