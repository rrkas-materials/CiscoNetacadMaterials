        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Cryptology is the science of making and breaking secret codes. Cryptography is a way to store and transmit data so only the intended recipient can read or process it. Modern cryptography uses computationally secure algorithms to make sure that cyber criminals cannot easily compromise protected information.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Data confidentiality ensures privacy so that only the intended receiver can read the message. Parties achieve this through encryption. Encryption is the process of scrambling data so that an unauthorized party cannot easily read it.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When enabling encryption, readable data is plaintext, or cleartext, while the encrypted version is encrypted text or ciphertext. Encryption converts the plaintext readable message to ciphertext, which is the unreadable, disguised message. Decryption reverses the process. Encryption also requires a key, which plays a critical role in encrypting and decrypting a message. The person possessing the key can decrypt the ciphertext to plaintext.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Historically, parties have used various encryption algorithms and methods. An algorithm is the process or formula used to solve a problem. Julius Caesar is said to have secured messages by putting two sets of the alphabet, side-by-side, and then shifting one of them by a specific number of places. The number of places in the shift serves as the key. He converted plaintext into ciphertext using this key, and only his generals, who also had the key, knew how to decipher the messages. This method is the Caesar cipher. The figure shows a secret message using the Caesar cipher.</p>
