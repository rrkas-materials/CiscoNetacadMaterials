          <p>Cryptographic encryption can provide confidentiality by incorporating various tools and protocols.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are two approaches to ensuring the security of data when using encryption. The first is to protect the algorithm. If the security of an encryption system depends on the secrecy of the algorithm itself, the most important aspect is to guard the algorithm at all costs. Every time someone finds out the details of the algorithm, every party involved would need to change the algorithm. That approach does not sound very secure or manageable. The second approach is to protect the keys. With modern cryptography, the algorithms are public. The cryptographic keys ensure the secrecy of the data. Cryptographic keys are passwords that are part of the input into an encryption algorithm together along with the data requiring encryption.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are two classes of encryption algorithms:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Symmetric algorithms</b> - These algorithms use the same pre-shared key, sometimes called a secret key pair, to encrypt and decrypt data. Both the sender and receiver know the pre-shared key before any encrypted communication begins. As shown in Figure 1, symmetric algorithms use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the plaintext. Encryption algorithms that use a common key are simpler and need less computational power.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Asymmetric algorithms</b> - Asymmetrical encryption algorithms use one key to encrypt data and a different key to decrypt data. One key is public and the other is private. In a public-key encryption system, any person can encrypt a message using the public key of the receiver, and the receiver is the only one that can decrypt it using his private key. Parties exchange secure messages without needing a pre-shared key, as shown in Figure 2. Asymmetric algorithms are more complex. These algorithms are resource intensive and slower to execute.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">There are two figures on this page. Figure 1 titled Symmetric encryption example provides an example of a symmetric algorithm where the key that creates the ciphertext is the same key required to decrypt the ciphertext. Figure 2 titled asymmetric encryption example provides an example of an asymmetric algorithm where the key that creates the ciphertext is the not same key used to decrypt the ciphertext.</div>
