        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Data integrity is a fundamental component of information security. The need for data integrity varies based on how an organization uses data. For example, Facebook does not verify the data that a user posts in a profile. A bank or financial organization assigns a higher importance to data integrity than Facebook does. Transactions and customer accounts must be accurate. In a healthcare organization, data integrity might be a matter of life or death. Prescription information must be accurate. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Protecting data integrity is a constant challenge for most organizations. Loss of data integrity can render entire data resources unreliable or unusable.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">The need for data integrity is broken up into four classifications. At the critical level is healthcare and emergency services where all data is validated and tested and data is verified and deemed trustworthy. Examples include healthcare and financial records. At a high level is ecommerce and analytics where all data is validated and data is checked and deemed trustworthy. A database is a good example of the need for a high level of data integrity. At the Mid Level is online sales and search engines where little verification is performed and data is not completely trustworthy such as data collected with publicly posted forms. At the Low Level are blogs and personal posting sites where data may not be verified resulting in a low level of trust. This category includes public opinion and open contribution.</div>
