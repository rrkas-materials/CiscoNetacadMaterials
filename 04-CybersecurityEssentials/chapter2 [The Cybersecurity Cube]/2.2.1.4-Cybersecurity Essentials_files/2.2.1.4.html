          <p>Confidentiality and privacy seem interchangeable, but from a legal standpoint, they mean different things. Most privacy data is confidential, but not all confidential data is private. Access to confidential information occurs after confirming proper authorization. Financial institutions, hospitals, medical professionals, law firms, and businesses handle confidential information. Confidential information has a non-public status. Maintaining confidentiality is more of an ethical duty. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Privacy is the appropriate use of data. When organizations collect information provided by customers or employees, they should only use that data for its intended purpose. Most organizations will require the customer or employee to sign a release form giving the organization permission to use the data.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>All of the laws listed in the figure include a provision for dealing with privacy starting with U.S. laws in Figure 1. Figure 2 lists a sampling of international efforts. Most of these laws are a response to the massive growth in data collection. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The growing number of privacy related statutes create a tremendous burden on organizations that collect and analyze data. Policies are the best way for an organization to comply with the growing number of privacy related laws. Policies enable organizations to enforce specific rules, procedures, and processes when collecting, storing, and sharing data. </p>
