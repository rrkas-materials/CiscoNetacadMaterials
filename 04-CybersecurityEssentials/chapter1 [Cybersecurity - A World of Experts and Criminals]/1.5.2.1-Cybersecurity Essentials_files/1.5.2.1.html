The CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) coordinates communication among experts during security emergencies to help prevent future incidents. CERT also responds to major security incidents and analyzes product vulnerabilities. CERT manages changes relating to progressive intruder techniques and to the difficulty of detecting attacks and catching attackers. It also develops and promotes the use of appropriate technology and systems management practices to resist attacks on networked systems, to limit damage, and to ensure continuity of services. SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security (SANS) Institute resources are largely free upon request and include the popular Internet Storm Center, the Internetâ€™s early warning system; NewsBites, the weekly news digest; @RISK, the weekly vulnerability digest; flash security alerts; and more than 1,200 award-winning, original research papers. SANS also develops security courses. The Mitre Corporation maintains a list of common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) used by prominent security organizations. Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) is a security organization that brings together a variety of computer security incident response teams from government, commercial, and educational organizations to foster cooperation and coordination in information sharing, incident prevention and rapid reaction.
