        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Organizations that want to maximize the availability of their systems and data may take extraordinary measures to minimize or eliminate data loss. The goal is to minimize the downtime of mission critical processes. If employees cannot perform their regular duties, the organization is in jeopardy of losing revenue.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Organizations measure availability by percentage of uptime. This chapter begins by explaining the concept of five nines. Many industries must maintain the highest availability standards because downtime might literally mean a difference between life and death. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This chapter discusses various approaches that organizations can take to help meet their availability goals. Redundancy provides backup and includes extra components for computers or network systems to ensure the systems remain available. Redundant components can include hardware such as disk drives, servers, switches, and routers or software such as operating systems, applications, and databases. The chapter also discusses resiliency, the ability of a server, network, or data center to recover quickly and continue operation. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Organizations must be prepared to respond to an incident by establishing procedures that they follow after an event occurs. The chapter concludes with a discussion of disaster recovery and business continuity planning which are both critical in maintaining availability to an organizationâ€™s resources.</p>
