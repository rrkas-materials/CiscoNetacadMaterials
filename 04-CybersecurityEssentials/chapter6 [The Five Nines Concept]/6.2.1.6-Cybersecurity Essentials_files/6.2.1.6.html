          <p>Mitigation involves reducing the severity of the loss or the likelihood of the loss from occurring. Many technical controls mitigate risk including authentication systems, file permissions, and firewalls. Organization and security professionals must understand that risk mitigation can have both positive and negative impact on the organization. Good risk mitigation finds a balance between the negative impact of countermeasures and controls and the benefit of risk reduction. There are four common ways to reduce risk:</p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Accept the risk and periodically re-assess</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Reduce the risk by implementing controls</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Avoid the risk by totally changing the approach</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Transfer the risk to a third party</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A short-term strategy is to accept the risk necessitating the creation of contingency plans for that risk. People and organizations have to accept risk on a daily basis. Modern methodologies reduce risk by developing software incrementally and providing regular updates and patches to address vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Outsourcing services, purchasing insurance, or purchasing maintenance contracts are all examples of risk transfer. Hiring specialists to perform critical tasks to reduce risk can be a good decision and yield greater results with less long term investment. A good risk mitigation plan can include two or more strategies.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">When an organization chooses to accept risk, it will Periodically re-assess accepted risks in ongoing processes as a normal feature of business operations and modify mitigation measures. When an organization chooses to reduce risk, it may design a new business process with adequate built-in risk control and containment measures from the start. An organization that chooses to avoid risk altogether would include measures such as physically disconnecting from the Internet. An organization that chooses to transfer risk would use a third-party such as an insurance company or an external agency.</div>
