          <p>One of the great vulnerabilities of wireless networks is the use of rogue access points. Access points are the devices that communicate with the wireless devices and connect them back to the wired network. Any device that has a wireless transmitter and hardwired interface to a network can potentially act as a rouge or unauthorized access point. The rouge access point can imitate an authorized access point. The result is that wireless devices on the wireless network establish communication with the rouge access point instead of the authorized access point. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The imposter can receive connection requests, copy the data in the request and forward the data to the authorized network access point. This type of man-in-the-middle attack is very difficult to detect and can result in stolen login credentials and transmitted data. To prevent rouge access points, the computer industry developed mutual authentication.  Mutual authentication, also called two-way authentication, is a process or technology in which both entities in a communications link authenticate to each other. In a wireless network environment, the client authenticates to the access point and the access point authenticates the client. This improvement enabled clients to detect rouge access points before connecting to the unauthorized device.</p>
