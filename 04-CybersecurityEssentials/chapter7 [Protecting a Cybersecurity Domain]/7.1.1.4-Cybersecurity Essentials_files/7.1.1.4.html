        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>A host-based solution is a software application that runs on a local host computer to protect it. The software works with the operating system to help prevent attacks. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Host-based Firewalls</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A software firewall is a program that runs on a computer to allow or deny traffic between the computer and other connected computers. The software firewall applies a set of rules to data transmissions through inspection and filtering of data packets. Windows Firewall is an example of a software firewall. The Windows operating system installs it by default during installation.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The user can control the type of data sent to and from the computer by opening or blocking selected ports. Firewalls block incoming and outgoing network connections, unless exceptions are defined to open and close the ports required by a program.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 1, the user selects Inbound Rules to configure the types of traffic allowed to pass through to the system. Configuring inbound rules will help protect the system from unwanted traffic.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Host Intrusion Detection Systems</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A host intrusion detection system (HIDS) is software that runs on a host computer that monitors suspicious activity. Each server or desktop system that requires protection will need to have the software installed as shown in Figure 2. HIDS monitors system calls and file system access to ensure that the requests are not the result of malicious activity. It can also monitor system registry settings. The registry maintains configuration information about the computer.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>HIDS stores all log data locally. It can also affect system performance because it is resource intensive. A host intrusion detection system cannot monitor any network traffic that does not reach the host system, but it does monitor operating system and critical system processes specific to that host.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">Figure 1 is a screen shot of Windows Firewall advanced security. Figure 2 shows a network comprised of a database server and four workstations. The server and two of the workstations have the IDS Agent installed. The host intrusion detection system will monitor just the system on which it is installed.</div>
