          <p>HVAC systems are critical to the safety of people and information systems in the organization's facilities. When designing modern IT facilities, these systems play a very important role in the overall security. HVAC systems control the ambient environment (temperature, humidity, airflow, and air filtering) and must be planned for and operated along with other data center components such as computing hardware, cabling, data storage, fire protection, physical security systems and power. Almost all physical computer hardware devices come with environmental requirements that include acceptable temperature and humidity ranges. Environmental requirements appear in a product specifications document or in a physical planning guide. It is critical to maintain these environmental requirements to prevent system failures and extend the life of IT systems. Commercial HVAC systems and other building management systems now connect to the Internet for remote monitoring and control. Recent events have shown such systems (often called "smart systems") also raise big security implications.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>One of the risks associated with smart systems is that the individuals who access and manage the system work for a contractor or a third-party vendor. Because HVAC technicians need to be able to find information quickly, crucial data tends to be stored in many different places, making it accessible to even more people. Such a situation allows a wide network of individuals, including even associates of contractors, to gain access to the credentials for an HVAC system. The interruption of these systems can pose considerable risk to the organization's information security.</p>
