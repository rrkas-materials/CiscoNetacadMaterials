          <p>Biometrics describes the automated methods of recognizing an individual based on a physiological or behavioral characteristic. Biometric authentication systems include measurements of the face, fingerprint, hand geometry, iris, retina, signature, and voice. Biometric technologies can be the foundation of highly secure identification and personal verification solutions. The popularity and use of biometric systems has increased because of the increased number of security breaches and transaction fraud. Biometrics provides confidential financial transactions and personal data privacy. For example, Apple uses fingerprint technology with its smartphones. The userâ€™s fingerprint unlocks the device and accesses various apps such as online banking or payment apps.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When comparing biometric systems there are several important factors to consider including accuracy, speed or throughput rate, acceptability to users, uniqueness of the biometric organ and action, resistance to counterfeiting, reliability, data storage requirements, enrollment time, and intrusiveness of the scan. The most important factor is accuracy. Accuracy is expressed in error types and rates.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The first error rate is Type I Errors or false rejections. A Type I Error rejects a person that registers and is an authorized user. In access control, if the requirement is to keep the bad guys out, false rejection is the least important error. However, in many biometric applications, false rejections can have a very negative impact on business.  For example, bank or retail store needs to authenticate customer identity and account balance. False rejection means that the transaction or sale is lost, and the customer becomes upset. Most bankers and retailers are willing to allow a few false accepts as long as there are minimal false rejects.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The acceptance rate is stated as a percentage and is the rate at which a system accepts unenrolled individuals or imposters as authentic users. False acceptance is a Type II error. Type II errors allow the bad guys in so they are normally considered to be the most important error for a biometric access control system.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The most widely used method to measure the accuracy of biometric authentication is the Crossover Error Rate (CER). The CER is the rate where false rejection rate and the false acceptance rate are equal as shown in the figure.  </p>
