        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Equifax Inc. is one of the nationwide consumer credit reporting agencies in the United States. This company collects information on millions of individual customers and businesses worldwide. Based on the collected information, credit scores and credit reports are created about the customers. This information could affect the customers when they apply for loans and when they are looking for employment.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In September 2017, Equifax publicly announced a data breach event. The attackers exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts web application software. The company believes that millions of U.S. consumers' sensitive personal data were accessed by the cyber criminals between May and July of 2017. The personal data includes the customers' full names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and other personally identifiable information. There is evidence that the breach may have affected customers in United Kingdom and Canada. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Equifax established a dedicated web site that allows the consumers to determine if their information was compromised, and to sign up for credit monitoring and identity theft protection. Using a new domain name, instead of using a subdomain of equifax.com, this allowed nefarious parties to create unauthorized websites with similar names. These websites can be used as part of a phishing scheme to trick you into providing personal information. Furthermore, an employee from Equifax provided an incorrect web link in social media for worried customers. Fortunately, this web site was taken down within 24 hours. It was created by an individual who use it as an educational opportunity to expose the vulnerabilities that exists in Equifax's response page.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As a concerned consumer, you may want to quickly verify if your information was compromised, so you can minimize the impact. In a time of crisis, you may be tricked into using unauthorized websites. You should be cautious about providing personal information so you do not become a victim again. Furthermore, companies are responsible for keeping our information safe from unauthorized access. Companies need to regularly patch and update their software to mitigate exploitation of known vulnerabilities. Their employees should be educated and informed about the procedures to safeguard the information and what to do in the event of a breach.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the real victims of this breach are the individuals whose data may have been compromised. In this case, Equifax has the burden of protecting the collected consumer data while conducting credit checks because the customers did not choose to use the services provided by Equifax. The consumer has to trust the company to safeguard the collected information. Furthermore, the attackers can use this data to assume your identity, and it is very difficult to prove otherwise because both the attacker and the victim know the same information. In these situations, the most you can do is be vigilant when you are providing personally identifiable information over the Internet. Check your credit reports regularly (once per month or once per quarter). Immediately report any false information, such as applications for credit that you did not initiate, or purchases on your credit cards that you did not make. </p>
