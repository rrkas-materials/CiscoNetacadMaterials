        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>The online password manager, LastPass, detected unusual activity on its network in July 2015. It turned out that hackers had stolen user email addresses, password reminders, and authentication hashes. Fortunately for the users, the hackers were unable to obtain anyone’s encrypted password vaults.</p>
          <p>Even though there was a security breach, LastPass could still safeguard the users’ account information. LastPass requires email verification or multi-factor authentication whenever there is a new login from an unknown device or IP address. The hackers would also need the master password to access the account.</p>
          <p>LastPass users also have some responsibility in safeguarding their own accounts. The users should always use complex master passwords and change the master passwords periodically. The users should always beware of Phishing attacks. An example of a Phishing attack would be if an attacker sent fake emails claiming to be from LastPass. The emails ask the users to click an embedded link and change the password. The link in the email goes to a fraudulent version of the website used to steal the master password. The users should never click the embedded links in an email. The users should also be careful with their password reminder. The password reminder should not give away your passwords. Most importantly, the users should enable multi-factor authentication when available for any website that offers it.</p>
          <p>If the users and service providers both utilize the proper tools and procedures to safeguard the users’ information, the users’ data could still be protected, even in the event of security breach.</p>
