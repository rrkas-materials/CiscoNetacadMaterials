          <p>Many other businesses and industries are hiring cybersecurity professionals. There are several online search engines to help you find the right job in cybersecurity:</p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>

                <a href="https://itjobmatch.com/" target="_blank">ITJobMatch</a> – The ITJobMatch search engine specializes in IT jobs of every kind, all over the globe.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>

            </p><ul>

          <p>These are just three of many different online job search sites. Even if you are just starting your education in IT and cybersecurity, looking at job search engines is a good way to see what kinds of jobs are available, all over the world.</p>
          <p>Depending on your interest in cybersecurity, different types of jobs can be available to you, and they can require specialized skills certifications. For example, a penetration tester, also known as an ethical hacker, searches and exploits security vulnerabilities in applications, networks and systems. To become a penetration tester, you will need to gain experience in other IT jobs, such as security administrator, network administrator, and system administrator. Each one of these jobs requires its own set of skills that will help you become a valuable asset to an organization.</p>
