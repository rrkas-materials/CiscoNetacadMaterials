        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Risk analysis is the process of analyzing the dangers posed by natural and human-caused events to the assets of an organization.  </p>
          <p>A user performs an asset identification to help determine which assets to protect. A risk analysis has four goals:</p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Identify assets and their value</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Identify vulnerabilities and threats</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Quantify the probability and impact of the identified threats</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Balance the impact of the threat against the cost of the countermeasure</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are two approaches to risk analysis.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Quantitative Risk Analysis </b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A quantitative analysis assigns numbers to the risk analysis process (Figure 1). The asset value is the replacement cost of the asset. The value of an asset can also be measured by the income gained through use of the asset. The exposure factor (EF) is a subjective value expressed as a percentage that an asset loses due to a particular threat.  If a total loss occurs, the EF equals 1.0 (100%). In the quantitative example, the server has an asset value of $15,000. When the server fails, a total loss occurs (the EF equals 1.0). The asset value of $15,000 multiplied by the exposure factor of 1 results in a single loss expectancy of $15,000. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) is the probability that a loss will occur during the year (also expressed as a percentage). An ARO can be greater than 100% if a loss can occur more than once a year.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The calculation of the annual loss expectancy (ALE) gives management some guidance on what it should spend to protect the asset.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Qualitative Risk Analysis</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Qualitative Risk Analysis uses opinions and scenarios. Figure 2 provides an example of table used in qualitative risk analysis, which plots the likelihood of a threat against its impact. For example, the threat of a server failure may be likely, but its impact may only be marginal. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A team evaluates each threat to an asset and plots it in the table. The team ranks the results and uses the results as a guide. They may determine to take action on only threats that fall within the red zone. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The numbers used in the table do not directly relate to any aspect of the analysis. For example, a catastrophic impact of 4 is not twice as bad as a marginal impact of 2. This method is subjective in nature.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">Figure 1: If the single loss expectancy is $15,000, and the annualized rate of occurrence is 15%, the annualized loss expectancy comes to $2,250. The organization may choose to accept the risk if the cost of the countermeasure is more than the potential loss. Figure 2: The quantitative tables is broken down into red, orange, yellow, and green zones. Any asset scored in the red zone will need to be addressed further. The orange and yellow zones may require further evaluation depending on the organization's parameters. Scores in the green zone do not need to be addressed.</div>
