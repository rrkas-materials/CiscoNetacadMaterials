          <p>High availability incorporates three major principles to achieve the goal of uninterrupted access to data and services:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>1. Elimination or reduction of single-points of failure</p>
          <p>2. System Resiliency </p>
          <p>3. Fault Tolerance </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Click each principle in the figure for a brief description.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It is important to understand the ways to address a single point of failure. A single point of failure can include central routers or switches, network services, and even highly skilled IT staff. The key is that a loss of the system, process, or person can have a very disruptive impact on the entire system. The key is to have processes, resources, and components that reduce single points of failure. High availability clusters is one way to provide redundancy. These clusters consist of a group of computers that have access to the same-shared storage and have identical network configurations. All servers take part in processing a service simultaneously. From the outside, the server group looks like one device. If a server within the cluster fails, the other servers continue to process the same service as the failed device. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Systems resiliency refers to the capability to maintain availability of data and operational processing despite attacks or disrupting event. Generally, this requires redundant systems, in terms of both power and processing, so that should one system fail, the other can take over operations without any break in service. System resiliency is more than hardening devices; it requires that both data and services be available even when under attack.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Fault tolerance enables a system to continue to operate if one or more components fail. Data mirroring is one example of fault tolerance. Should a "fault" occur, causing disruption in a device such as a disk controller, the mirrored system provides the requested data with no apparent interruption in service to the user.</p>
