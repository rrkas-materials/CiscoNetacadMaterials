        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Application resilience is the applicationâ€™s ability to react to problems in one of its components while still functioning. Downtime is due to failures caused by application errors or infrastructure failures. An administrator will eventually need to shut down applications for patching, version upgrades, or to deploy new features. Downtime can also be the result of data corruption, equipment failures, application errors, and human errors.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many organizations try to balance out the cost of achieving the resiliency of application infrastructure with the cost of losing customers or business due to an application failure. Application high availability is complex and costly. The figure shows three availability solutions to address application resilience. As the availability factor of each solution increases, the complexity and cost also increase.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">Fault tolerant hardware (most complex and most costly) is a system designed by building multiples of all critical components into the same computer. Cluster architecture is a group of servers that act like a single system. Backups copy files for the purpose of being able to restore them if data loss occurs (least complex and least costly).</div>
