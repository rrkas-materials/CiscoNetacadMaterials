          <p>Phishing is a form of fraud. Cyber criminals use email, instant messaging, or other social media to try to gather information such as login credentials or account information by masquerading as a reputable entity or person. Phishing occurs when a malicious party sends a fraudulent email disguised as being from a legitimate, trusted source. The message intent is to trick the recipient into installing malware on his or her device or into sharing personal or financial information. An example of phishing is an email forged to look like it came from a retail store asking the user to click a link to claim a prize. The link may go to a fake site asking for personal information, or it may install a virus.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Spear phishing is a highly targeted phishing attack. While phishing and spear phishing both use emails to reach the victims, spear phishing sends customized emails to a specific person. The criminal researches the targetâ€™s interests before sending the email. For example, a criminal learns that the target is interested in cars and has been looking to buy a specific model of car. The criminal joins the same car discussion forum where the target is a member, forges a car sale offering, and sends an email to the target. The email contains a link for pictures of the car. When the target clicks on the link, he or she unknowingly installs malware on the computer.
