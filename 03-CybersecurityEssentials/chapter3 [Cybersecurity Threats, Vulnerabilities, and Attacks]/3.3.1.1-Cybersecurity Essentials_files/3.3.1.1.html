          <p>Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are a type of network attack. A DoS attack results in some sort of interruption of network services to users, devices, or applications. There are two major types of DoS attacks:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>
                <b>Overwhelming Quantity of Traffic</b> – The attacker sends an enormous quantity of data at a rate that the network, host, or application cannot handle. This causes a slowdown in transmission or response, or a crash of a device or service.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>
                <b>Maliciously Formatted Packets</b> – The attacker sends a maliciously formatted packet to a host or application and the receiver is unable to handle it. For example, an application cannot identify packets containing errors or improperly formatted packets forwarded by the attacker. This causes the receiving device to run very slowly or crash.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>DoS attacks are a major risk because they can easily interrupt communication and cause significant loss of time and money. These attacks are relatively simple to conduct, even by an unskilled attacker.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The goal of a denial-of-service attack is to deny access to authorized users making the network unavailable (remember the three underlying security principles: confidentiality, integrity, and availability). Click Play in Figure 1 to view the animation of a DoS attack.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A Distributed DoS Attack (DDoS) is similar to a DoS attack, but it originates from multiple, coordinated sources. As an example, a DDoS attack could proceed as follows:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An attacker builds a network of infected hosts, called a botnet, comprised of zombies. Zombies are the infected hosts. The attacker uses handler systems to control the zombies. The zombie computers constantly scan and infect more hosts, creating more zombies. When ready, the hacker instructs the handler systems to make the botnet of zombies carry out a DDoS attack.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Click Play in Figure 2 to view the animations of a DDoS attack. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack uses many zombies to overwhelm a target.</p>
