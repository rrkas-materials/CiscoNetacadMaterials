          <p>Methods for dealing with spam include filtering email, educating the user about being cautious towards unknown email(s), and using host/server filters. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It is difficult to stop spam, but there are ways to diminish its effects. For example, most ISPs filter spam before it reaches the user’s inbox. Many antivirus and email software programs automatically perform email filtering. This means that they detect and remove spam from an email inbox. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Organizations must also make employees aware of the dangers of opening email attachments that may contain a virus or a worm. Do not assume that email attachments are safe, even when they come from a trusted contact. A virus may be trying to spread by using the sender’s computer. Always scan email attachments before opening them. </p>
          <p>The Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) is an industry association focused on eliminating the identity theft and fraud that result from phishing and email spoofing.</p>
