          <p>Security breaches can affect web browsers by displaying pop-up advertising, collecting personally identifiable information, or installing adware, viruses, or spyware. A criminal can hack a browser’s executable file, a browser’s components, or its plugins.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Plugins</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Flash and Shockwave plugins from Adobe enable the development of interesting graphic and cartoon animations that greatly enhance the look and feel of a web page. Plugins display the content developed using the appropriate software. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Until recently, plugins had a remarkable safety record. As Flash-based content grew and became more popular, criminals examined the Flash plugins and software, determined vulnerabilities, and exploited Flash Player. Successful exploitation could cause a system crash or allow a criminal to take control of the affected system. Expect increased data losses to occur as criminals continue to investigate the more popular plugins and protocols for vulnerabilities.</p>

            <b>SEO Poisoning</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Search engines such as Google work by ranking pages and presenting relevant results based on users’ search queries. Depending on the relevancy of web site content, it may appear higher or lower in the search result list. SEO, short for Search Engine Optimization, is a set of techniques used to improve a website’s ranking by a search engine. While many legitimate companies specialize in optimizing websites to better position them, SEO poisoning uses SEO to make a malicious website appear higher in search results. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The most common goal of SEO poisoning is to increase traffic to malicious sites that may host malware or perform social engineering. To force a malicious site to rank higher in search results, attackers take advantage of popular search terms.</p>

            <b>Browser Hijacker</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A browser hijacker is malware that alters a computer's browser settings to redirect the user to websites paid for by the cyber criminals' customers. Browser hijackers usually install without the user's permission and are usually part of a drive-by download. A drive-by download is a program that automatically downloads to the computer when a user visits a web site or views an HTML email message. Always read user agreements carefully when downloading programs to avoid this type of malware.</p>
