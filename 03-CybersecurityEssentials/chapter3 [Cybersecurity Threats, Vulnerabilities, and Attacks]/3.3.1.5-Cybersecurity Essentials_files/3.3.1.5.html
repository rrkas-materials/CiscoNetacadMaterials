        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>A zero-day attack, sometimes referred to as a zero-day threat, is a computer attack that tries to exploit software vulnerabilities that are unknown or undisclosed by the software vendor. The term zero hour describes the moment when someone discovers the exploit. During the time it takes the software vendor to develop and release a patch, the network is vulnerable to these exploits, as shown in the figure. Defending against these fast-moving attacks requires network security professionals to adopt a more sophisticated view of the network architecture. It is no longer possible to contain intrusions at a few points in the network.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">The figure on this page is a diagram that demonstrates the Microsoft zero-day vulnerability. The diagram shows a horizontal timeline. The first entry at the left end of the timeline says, “Day 0: Zero-day malware in the wild.” The next entry, which is at the center of the timeline says, “Day 16: First antivirus signature deployed.” The next entry to the right says, “Day 17: Second antivirus signature deployed.” The last entry at the right of the timeline says, “Day 18: Third antivirus signature deployed.” Day 16 to Day 18 are labelled as, “Traditional response.” Below day 17 is a label that says, “Security advisory issued.” Below day 18 is a label that says, “Microsoft IE patched.”</div>
