        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Social engineers rely on several tactics. Social engineering tactics include:</p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>
                <b>Authority</b> – people are more likely to comply when instructed by “an authority” </li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>
                <b>Intimidation</b> – criminals bully a victim into taking action</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>
                <b>Consensus/Social Proof</b> – people will take action if they think that other people like it too</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>
                <b>Scarcity</b> – people will take action when they think there is a limited quantity</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>
                <b>Urgency</b> – people will take action when they think there is a limited time</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>
                <b>Familiarity/Liking</b> – Criminals build a rapport with the victim to establish a relationship</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>
                <b>Trust</b> – Criminals build a trusting relationship with a victim which may require more time to establish</li>
            </ul>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">The figure provides the following examples of social engineering tactics: Authority - An executive opens an infected PDF that looks like an official subpoena. Intimidation - An executive’s secretary receives a call stating that her boss is about to give an important presentation, but his files are corrupt. The cybercriminal asks for the files to be sent immediately to him. Consensus - Criminals create websites with fake testimonials that promote a product indicating that it is safe. Scarcity - Criminals offer a limited opportunity that will not last hoping to spur the victim into taking action quickly. Urgency - Criminals establish a deadline for taking action based on a certain price. Familiarity - People are more likely to do what another person asks if they like that person. Trust - A “security expert” calls the victim offering advice and having the credentials to back it up. While helping the victim, the criminal discovers a “serious error” that needs immediate attention. The solution provides the criminal with the opportunity.</div>
