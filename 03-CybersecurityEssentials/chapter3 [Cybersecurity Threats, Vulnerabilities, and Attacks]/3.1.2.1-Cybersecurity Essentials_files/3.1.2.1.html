          <p>Email is a universal service used by billions worldwide. As one of the most popular services, email has become a major vulnerability to users and organizations. Spam, also known as junk mail, is unsolicited email. In most cases, spam is a method of advertising. However, spam can send harmful links, malware, or deceptive content. The end goal is to obtain sensitive information such as a social security number or bank account information. Most spam comes from multiple computers on networks infected by a virus or worm. These compromised computers send out as much bulk email as possible.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Even with these security features implemented, some spam might still get through. Watch for some of the more common indicators of spam:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>An email has no subject line.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>An email is requesting an update to an account.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>The email text has misspelled words or strange punctuation.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Links within the email are long and/or cryptic.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>An email looks like correspondence from a legitimate business.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>The email requests that the user open an attachment.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>

          <p></p>
          <p>If a user receives an email that contains one or more of these indicators, he or she should not open the email or any attachments. It is very common for an organization’s email policy to require a user receiving this type of email to report it to the cyber security staff. Almost all email providers filter spam. Unfortunately, spam still consumes bandwidth, and the recipient's server still has to process the message. </p>
