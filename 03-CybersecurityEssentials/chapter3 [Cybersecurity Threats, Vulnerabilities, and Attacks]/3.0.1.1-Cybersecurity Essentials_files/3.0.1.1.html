          <p>Threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks are the central focus of cybersecurity professionals. A threat is the possibility that a harmful event, such as an attack, will occur.  A vulnerability is a weakness that makes a target susceptible to an attack. An attack is a deliberate exploitation of a discovered weakness in computer information systems, either as specific targets or merely as targets of opportunity. Cyber criminals may have different motivations for selecting a target of an attack. Cyber criminals succeed by continuously searching for and identifying systems with clear vulnerabilities. Common victims include unpatched systems or systems missing virus and spam detection.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This chapter examines the most common cybersecurity attacks. Cybersecurity professionals must understand how each attack works, what it exploits, and how it affects the victim. The chapter begins by explaining the threat of malware and malicious code and then goes into explaining the types of deception involved with social engineering. A cyberattack is any type of offensive maneuver used by cyber criminals to target computer information systems, computer networks, or other computer devices. Cyber criminals launch offensive maneuvers against both wired and wireless networks.</p>
