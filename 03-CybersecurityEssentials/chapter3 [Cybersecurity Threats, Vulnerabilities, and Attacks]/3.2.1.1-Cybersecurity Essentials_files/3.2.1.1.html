        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Social engineering is a completely non-technical means for a criminal to gather information on a target. Social engineering is an attack that attempts to manipulate individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Social engineers often rely on people’s willingness to be helpful but also prey on people’s weaknesses. For example, an attacker could call an authorized employee with an urgent problem that requires immediate network access. The attacker could appeal to the employee’s vanity, invoke authority using name-dropping techniques, or appeal to the employee’s greed.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These are some types of social engineering attacks:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Pretexting</b> - This is when an attacker calls an individual and lies to them in an attempt to gain access to privileged data. An example involves an attacker who pretends to need personal or financial data in order to confirm the identity of the recipient.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Something for Something (Quid pro quo)</b> - This is when an attacker requests personal information from a party in exchange for something, like a gift.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">This figure illustrates an example of social engineering. The attacker impersonates a trusted co-worker to gather information from an unsuspecting victim. For example, the attacker may call and say, "Hi, this is Amy from the help desk. We need to upgrade the software on your computer after work hours. What is your user ID and password? You can change the password tomorrow when you log in.”</div>
