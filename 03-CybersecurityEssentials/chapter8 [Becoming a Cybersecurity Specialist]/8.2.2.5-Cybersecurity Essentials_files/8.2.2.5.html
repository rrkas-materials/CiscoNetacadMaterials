        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>The following U.S. laws protect privacy.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Privacy Act of 1974</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This act establishes a Code of Fair Information Practice that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Freedom of Information ACT (FOIA)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>FOIA enables public access to U.S. government records. FOIA carries a presumption of disclosure, so the burden is on the government as to why it cannot release the information.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are nine disclosure exemptions pertaining to FOIA.</p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>National security and foreign policy information</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Internal personnel rules and practices of an agency</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Information specifically exempted by statute</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Confidential business information</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Inter- or intra-agency communication subject to deliberative process, litigation, and other privileges</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Information that, if disclosed, would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Law enforcement records that implicate one of a set of enumerated concerns</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Agency information from financial institutions</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Geological and geophysical information concerning wells</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Family Education Records and Privacy Act (FERPA)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This Federal law gave students access to their education records. FERPA operates on an opt-in basis, as the student must approve the disclosure of information prior to the actual disclosure. When a student turns 18 years old or enters a postsecondary institution at any age, these rights under FERPA transfer from the student’s parents to the student.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This amendment to the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 prohibits the unauthorized access of a computer. The CFAA increased the scope of the previous Act to cases of great federal interest. These cases are defined as involving computers belonging to the federal government or some financial institutions or where the crime is interstate in nature.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This federal law applies to the online collection of personal information by persons or entities under U.S. jurisdiction from children under 13 years of age. Before information can be collected and used from children (ages 13 and under), parental permission needs to be obtained.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>U.S. Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) </b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The U.S. Congress passed CIPA in 2000 to protect children under the age of 17 from exposure to offensive Internet content and obscene material.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Video Privacy Protection Act protects an individual from having the video tapes, DVD’s and games rented disclosed to another party. The statute provides the protections by default, thus requiring a video rental company to obtain the renter’s consent to opt out of the protections if the company wants to disclose personal information about rentals. Many privacy advocates consider VPPA to be the strongest U.S. privacy law.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The standards mandate safeguards for physical storage, maintenance, transmission, and access to individuals’ health information. HIPAA mandates that organizations that use electronic signatures have to meet standards ensuring information integrity, signer authentication, and nonrepudiation. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>California Senate Bill 1386 (SB 1386)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>California was the first state to pass a law regarding the notification of the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information. Since then, many other states have followed suit. Each of these disclosure notice laws is different, making the case for a unifying federal statute compelling. This act requires that the agencies provide consumers notice of their rights and responsibilities. It mandates that the state notify citizens whenever PII is lost or disclosed. Since the passage of SB 1386, numerous other states have modeled legislation on this bill.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Privacy Policies</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Policies are the best way to ensure compliance across an organization, and a privacy policy plays an important role within the organization, especially with the numerous laws enacted to protect privacy. One of the direct outcomes of the legal statutes associated with privacy has been the development of a need for corporate privacy policies associated with data collection.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A privacy impact assessment ensures that personally identifiable information (PII) is properly handled throughout an organization.</p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Establish PIA scope.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Identify key stakeholders.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Document all contact with PII.</li>
            </ul>
