        <h1 tabindex="0">Ethics of a Cybersecurity Specialist</h1>
        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Ethics is the little voice in the background guiding a cybersecurity specialist as to what he should or should not do, regardless of whether it is legal. The organization entrusts the cybersecurity specialist with the most sensitive data and resources. The cybersecurity specialist needs to understand how the law and the organization’s interests help to guide ethical decisions. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Cyber criminals that break into a system, steal credit card numbers, and release a worm are performing unethical actions. How does an organization view the actions of a cybersecurity specialist if they are similar? For example, a cybersecurity specialist may have the opportunity to stop the spread of a worm preemptively by patching it. In effect, the cybersecurity specialist is releasing a worm. This worm is not malicious, though, so does this case get a pass?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The following ethical systems look at ethics from various perspectives.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Utilitarian Ethics</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>During the 19th century, Jeremy Benthan and John Stuart Mill created Utilitarian Ethics. The guiding principle is that any actions that provide the greatest amount of good over bad or evil are ethical choices.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>The Rights Approach</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The guiding principle for the Rights Approach is that individuals have the right to make their own choices. This perspective looks at how an action affects the rights of others to judge whether an action is right or wrong. These rights include the right to truth, privacy, safety, and that society applies laws fairly to all members of society.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>The Common-Good Approach</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Common-Good Approach proposes that the common good is whatever benefits the community.  In this case, a cybersecurity specialist looks at how an action affects the common good of society or the community. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>No clear-cut answers provide obvious solutions to the ethical issues that cybersecurity specialists face. The answer as to what is right or wrong can change depending on the situation and the ethical perspective.</p>
