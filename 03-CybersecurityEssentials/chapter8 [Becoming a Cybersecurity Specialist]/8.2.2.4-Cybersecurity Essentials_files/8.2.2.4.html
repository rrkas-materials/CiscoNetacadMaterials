        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Businesses are collecting ever-increasing amounts of personal information about their customers, from account passwords and email addresses to highly sensitive medical and financial information. Companies large and small recognize the value of big data and data analytics. This encourages organizations to collect and store information. Cyber criminals are always looking for ways to obtain such information or access and exploit a companyâ€™s most sensitive, confidential data. Organizations that collect sensitive data need to be good data custodians. In response to this growth in data collection, several laws require organizations that collect personal information to notify individuals if a breach of their personal data occurs.

          <p>The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) addresses a myriad of legal privacy issues that resulted from the increasing use of computers and other technology specific to telecommunications. Sections of this law address email, cellular communications, workplace privacy, and a host of other issues related to communicating electronically.</p>

            <b>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1986)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) has been in force for over 20 years. The CFAA provides the foundation for U.S. laws criminalizing unauthorized access to computer systems. The CFAA makes it a crime to knowingly access a computer considered either a government computer or a computer used in interstate commerce, without permission. The CFAA also criminalizes the use of a computer in a crime that is interstate in nature.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Act criminalizes trafficking in passwords or similar access information, and the act makes it a crime to transmit a program, code, or a command knowingly that results in damage.</p>
