          <p>The Network Operation Center (NOC) is one or more locations containing the tools that provide administrators with a detailed status of the organization’s network. The NOC is ground zero for network troubleshooting, performance monitoring, software distribution and updates, communications management, and device management.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Security Operation Center (SOC) is a dedicated site that monitors, assesses, and defends the organization’s information systems such as websites, applications, databases, data centers, networks, servers, and user systems. A SOC is a team of security analysts who detect, analyze, respond to, report on, and prevent cybersecurity incidents.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Both of these entities use a hierarchical tier structure to handle events. The first tier handles all events and escalates any event that it cannot handle to the second tier. Tier 2 staff reviews the event in detail to try to resolve it. If they cannot, they escalate the event to Tier 3, the subject matter experts.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To measure the overall effectiveness of an operation center, an organization will conduct realistic drills and exercises. A tabletop simulation exercise is a structured walk-through by a team to simulate an event and evaluate the center’s effectiveness. A more effective measure is to simulate a full-fledged intrusion with no warning. This involves using a Red Team, an independent group of individuals who challenges processes within an organization, to evaluate the organization’s effectiveness. For example, the Red Team should attack a critical mission system and include reconnaissance and attack, privilege escalation, and remote access.</p>
