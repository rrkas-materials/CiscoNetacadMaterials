          <p>The ISO 27000 is a universal framework for every type of organization. In order to use the framework effectively, an organization must narrow down which domains, control objectives, and controls apply to its environment and operations. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The ISO 27001 control objectives serve as a checklist. The first step an organization takes is to determine if these control objectives are applicable to the organization. Most organizations generate a document called the Statement of Applicability (SOA). The SOA defines which control objectives that the organization needs to use.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Different organizations place greater priority on confidentiality, integrity, and availability depending on the type of industry. For example, Google places the highest value on user data confidentiality and availability and less on integrity. Google does not verify user data. Amazon places high emphasis on availability. If the site is not available, Amazon does not make the sale. This does not mean that Amazon ignores confidentiality in favor of availability. Amazon just places a higher priority on availability. Therefore, Amazon may spend more resources ensuring that there are more servers available to handle customer purchases.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An organization tailors its use of the available control objectives and controls to best meet its priorities with regard to confidentiality, integrity and availability.</p>
