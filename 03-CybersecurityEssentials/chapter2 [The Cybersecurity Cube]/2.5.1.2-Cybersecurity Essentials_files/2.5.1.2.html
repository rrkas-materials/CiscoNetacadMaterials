          <p>ISO/IEC 27000 is an information security standard published in 2005 and revised in 2013. ISO publishes the ISO 27000 standards. Even though the standards are not mandatory, most countries use them as a de facto framework for implementing information security. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The ISO 27000 standards describe the implementation of a comprehensive information security management system (ISMS). An ISMS consists of all of the administrative, technical and operational controls to keep information safe within an organization. Twelve independent domains represent the components of the ISO 27000 standard. These twelve domains serve to organize, at a high level, the vast areas of information under the umbrella of information security. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The structure of the ISO cybersecurity model is different from the OSI model in that it uses domains rather than layers to describe the categories for security. The reason for this is that the ISO cybersecurity model is not a hierarchical relationship. It is a peer model in which each domain has a direct relationship with the other domains. The ISO 27000 cybersecurity model is very similar to the OSI model in that it is vital for cybersecurity specialists to understand both of these models to be successful. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Click each domain in the figure for a brief description.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The twelve domains serve as a common basis for developing organizational security standards and effective security management practices. They also help to facilitate communication between organizations.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">The twelve domains of Cybersecurity include the following: Risk Assessment is the first step in the risk management process. It determines the quantitative and qualitative value of risk related to a specific situation or recognized threat. Security Policy is the documents that address the constraints and behaviors of members of an organization and often specifies how data can be accessed and what data is accessible by whom. Organization of Information Security is the governance model set out by an organization for information security. Asset Management is an inventory of and classification scheme for information assets. Human resources security addresses security procedures relating to employees joining, moving within, and leaving an organization. Physical and environmental security describes the protection of the computer facilities within an organization. Communications and operations management describes the management of technical security controls in systems and networks. Information systems acquisition, development, and maintenance describes the integration of security into applications. Access control describes the restriction of access rights to networks, systems, applications, functions, and data. Information security incident management describes how to anticipate and respond to information security breaches. Business continuity management describes the protection, maintenance, and recovery of business-critical processes and systems. Compliance describes the process of ensuring conformance with information security policies, standards, and regulations.</div>
