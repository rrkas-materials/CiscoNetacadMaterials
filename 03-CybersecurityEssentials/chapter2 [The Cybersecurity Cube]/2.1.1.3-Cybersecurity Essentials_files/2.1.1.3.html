          <p>The third dimension of the Cybersecurity Cube defines the skills and discipline a cybersecurity professional can call upon to protect cyberspace. Cybersecurity professionals must use a range of different skills and disciplines available to them when protecting the data in the cyberspace. They must do this while remaining on the ‘right side’ of the law.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Cybersecurity Cube identifies the three types of skills and disciplines used to provide protection. The first skill includes the technologies, devices, and products available to protect information systems and fend off cyber criminals. Cybersecurity professionals have a reputation for mastering the technological tools at their disposal. However, McCumber reminds them that the technological tools are not enough to defeat cyber criminals. Cybersecurity professionals must also build a strong defense by establishing policies, procedures, and guidelines that enable the users of cyberspace to stay safe and follow good practices. Finally, users of cyberspace must strive to become more knowledgeable about the threats of the cyberspace and establish a culture of learning and awareness.</p>
