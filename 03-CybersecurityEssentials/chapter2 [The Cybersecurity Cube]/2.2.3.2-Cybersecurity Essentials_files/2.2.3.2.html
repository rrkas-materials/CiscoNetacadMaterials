          <p>People use various information systems in their day-to-day lives. Computers and information systems control communications, transportation and the manufacturing of products. The continuous availability of information systems is imperative to modern life. The term high availability, describes systems designed to avoid downtime. High availability ensures a level of performance for a higher than normal period. High availability systems typically include three design principles (Figure 1):</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Eliminate single points of failure</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Provide for reliable crossover</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Detect failures as they occur</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>The goal is the ability to continue to operate under extreme conditions, such as during an attack. One of the most popular high availability practices is five nines. The five nines refer to 99.999%. This means that downtime is less than 5.26 minutes per year. Figure 2 provides three approaches to five nines.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">Figure 1: To eliminate single points of failure, identify all devices and components in a system that would result in a system failure should that device or component fail. Methods to eliminate single points of failures include hot stand-by devices, redundant components, and multiple connections or pathways. To provide for reliable crossover, use redundant power supplies, backup power systems and backup communications systems all provide for reliable crossover. Active device and system monitoring detects many types of events including system and device failures. Monitoring systems may even trigger the backup system in the case of a failure. Figure 2: Systems standardization provides for systems that use the same components. Parts inventories are easier to maintain and swapping components during an emergency is possible. With shared component systems, systems are built so that a backup system can totally replace one that failed. Clustering multiple devices grouped together provide a service that appears to be a single entity to a user. If one device fails, the other devices remain available.</div>
