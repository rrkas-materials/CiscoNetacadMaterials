          <p>Protecting against invalid data modification during processing can have an adverse impact. Software errors are the reason for many mishaps and disasters. For example, just two weeks before Christmas, some of Amazon’s third-party retailers experienced a change in the advertised price on their items to just one cent. The glitch lasted for one hour. The error resulted in thousands of shoppers getting the deal of a lifetime and the company losing revenue. In 2016, the Nest thermostat malfunctioned and left users with no heat. The Nest thermostat is a smart technology owned by Google. A software glitch left users, literally, out in the cold. A software update went wrong, forcing the device’s batteries to drain and leaving it unable to control temperature. As a result, customers were unable to heat their homes or get hot water on one of the coldest weekends of the year. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Protecting data during processing requires well-designed systems. Cybersecurity professionals design policies and procedures that require testing, maintaining, and updating systems to keep them operating with the least amount of errors.</p>
