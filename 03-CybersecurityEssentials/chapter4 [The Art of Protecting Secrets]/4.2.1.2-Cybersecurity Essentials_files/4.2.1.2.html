          <p>Logical access controls are the hardware and software solutions used to manage access to resources and systems. These technology-based solutions include tools and protocols that computer systems use for identification, authentication, authorization, and accountability.</p>

          <p>Logical access controls include the following:</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">Encryption is the process of taking a message that is easily read by anyone and encoding it so that only authorized users can read it. Operating systems offer encryption features to encrypt devices such as a hard drive. Apple builds encryption into the hardware and firmware of its iPads and iPhones. Smart cards have an embedded microchip that can communicate with the host computer or card reader. A password is a protected string of characters used to authenticate a user. A password is the most common method used for authentication. Biometrics analyze users’ physical characteristics to verify their identify. It is the most accurate method for identification verification, but it is also the most expensive method. ACLs can define and control different types of traffic on a network device to meet specific security requirements. An ACL is a sequential list of permit or deny statements that filter traffic based on certain criteria such as the source or destination IP address. Authentication protocols transfer authentication data between two objects such as a client and a server. There are protocols that validate the identity of remote clients (Point-to-Point Protocol) such as Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) or Challenge-handshake authentication protocol (CHAP). There are more complex protocols used in larger networks for verifying authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA architecture protocols) such as TACACS+ and RADIUS. Kerberos is a centralized network authentication system used in many operating systems. A firewall prevents undesirable traffic from entering an area within a network. A firewall enforces an access control policy between networks. Routers connect at least two networks with either a wired or wireless connection. A router determines the next point that a data packet needs to take to get the packet to its final destination. An edge router is the last router between the internal network and the Internet, an untrusted network. Routers can function as the first and last line of defense for a network. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors either a network or a system for suspicious activities. An IDS also provides notification that an event occurred. A clipping level is a system's threshold for specific errors or mistakes allowed before triggering a red flag. Users will make mistakes, but will they try to log in to the network 100 times at 2 a.m.?</div>
