            <b>Internal Security Threats</b>
          </p>
          <p>Attacks can originate from within an organization or from outside of the organization, as shown in the figure. An internal user, such as an employee or contract partner, can accidently or intentionally:</p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Mishandle confidential data</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Threaten the operations of internal servers or network infrastructure devices</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Facilitate outside attacks by connecting infected USB media into the corporate computer system</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Accidentally invite malware onto the network through malicious email or websites</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>Internal threats have the potential to cause greater damage than external threats because internal users have direct access to the building and its infrastructure devices. Internal attackers typically have knowledge of the corporate network, its resources, and its confidential data. They may also have knowledge of security countermeasures, policies and higher levels of administrative privileges.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>External Security Threats</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>External threats from amateurs or skilled attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in networked devices, or can use social engineering, such as trickery, to gain access. External attacks exploit weaknesses or vulnerabilities to gain access to internal resources.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Traditional Data</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Corporate data includes personnel information, intellectual property, and financial data. Personnel information includes application materials, payroll, offer letters, employee agreements, and any information used in making employment decisions. Intellectual property, such as patents, trademarks and new product plans, allows a business to gain economic advantage over its competitors. Consider this intellectual property as a trade secret; losing this information can be disastrous for the future of the company. Financial data, such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements, gives insight into the health of the company.</p>
