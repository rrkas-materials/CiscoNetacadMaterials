          <p>The Workforce Framework categorizes cybersecurity work into seven categories. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Operate and Maintain</b> includes providing the support, administration, and maintenance required to ensure IT system performance and security.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Protect and Defend</b> includes the identification, analysis, and mitigation of threats to internal systems and networks.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Investigate</b> includes the investigation of cyber events and/or cyber crimes involving IT resources.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Collect and Operate</b> includes specialized denial and deception operations and the collection of cybersecurity information.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Analyze</b> includes highly specialized review and evaluation of incoming cybersecurity information to determine if it is useful for intelligence.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Oversight and Development</b> provides for leadership, management, and direction to conduct cybersecurity work effectively. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Securely Provision</b> includes conceptualizing, designing, and building secure IT systems.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Within each category, there are several specialty areas. The specialty areas then define common types of cybersecurity work.</p>
          <p>The figure displays each of the categories and a brief description of each.</p>
