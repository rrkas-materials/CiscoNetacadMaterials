          <p>As previously described, there are experts who are innovators and visionaries. They build the different cyber domains of the Internet. They have the capacity to recognize the power of data and harness it. Then they build their organizations and provide services, as well as protecting people from cyberattacks. Ideally, cybersecurity professionals should recognize the threat that data poses if it is used against people.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Threats and vulnerabilities are the main concern of cybersecurity professionals. Two situations are especially critical: </p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>When a threat is the possibility that a harmful event, such as an attack, will occur. </li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>When a vulnerability makes a target susceptible to an attack. </li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For example, data in the wrong hands can result in a loss of privacy for the owners, can affect their credit, or jeopardize their career or personal relationships. Identity theft is big business. However, it is not necessarily the Googles and Facebooks that pose the greatest risk. Schools, hospitals, financial institutions, government agencies, the workplace and e-commerce pose even greater risks. Organizations like Google and Facebook have the resources to hire top cybersecurity talent to protect their domains. As more organizations build large databases containing all of our personal data, the need for cybersecurity professionals increases. This leaves smaller businesses and organizations competing for the remaining pool of cybersecurity professionals. Cyber threats are particularly dangerous to certain industries and the records they must maintain.</p>
