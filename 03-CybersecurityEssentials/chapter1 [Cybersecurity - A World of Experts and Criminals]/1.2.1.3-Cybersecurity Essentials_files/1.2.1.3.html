        <div tabindex="0">
          <p>Cyber criminal profiles and motives have changed over the years. Hacking started in the ‘60s with phone freaking (or phreaking) which refers to using various audio frequencies to manipulate phone systems. In the mid-‘80s, criminals used computer dial-up modems to connect computers to networks and used password-cracking programs to gain access to data. Nowadays, criminals are going beyond just stealing information. Criminals can now use malware and viruses as high tech weapons. However, the greatest motivation for most cyber criminals is financial. Cybercrime has become more lucrative than the illegal drug trade.</p>

          <p>General hacker profiles and motives have changed quite a bit. The figure displays modern hacking terms and a brief description of each.</p>

      <div id="media-description" tabindex="0">The figure is composed of interactive popups that define modern hacking terms. The term script kiddies emerged in the 1990s and refers to teenagers or inexperienced hackers running existing scripts, tools, and exploits, to cause harm, but typically not for profit. A vulnerability broker are usually grey hat hackers who attempt to discover exploits and report them to vendors, sometimes for prizes or rewards. Hacktivists are grey hat hackers who rally and protest against different political and social ideas. Hacktivists publicly protest against organizations or governments by posting articles, videos, leaking sensitive information, and performing distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Cyber criminals are black hat hackers who are either self-employed or working for large cybercrime organizations. Each year, cyber criminals are responsible for stealing billions of dollars from consumers and businesses. State-sponsored hackers depend on a person’s perspective. These are either white hat or black hat hackers who steal government secrets, gather intelligence, and sabotage networks. Their targets are foreign governments, terrorist groups, and corporations. Most countries in the world participate to some degree in state-sponsored hacking.</div>
