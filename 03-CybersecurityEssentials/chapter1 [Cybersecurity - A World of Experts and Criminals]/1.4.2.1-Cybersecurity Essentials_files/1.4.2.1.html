          <p>Software vulnerabilities today rely on programming mistakes, protocol vulnerabilities, or system misconfigurations. The cyber criminal merely has to exploit one of these. For example, a common attack involved constructing an input to a program in order to sabotage the program, making it malfunction. This malfunction provided a doorway into the program or caused it to leak information.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There is a growing sophistication seen in cyberattacks today. An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a continuous computer hack that occurs under the radar against a specific object. Criminals usually choose an APT for business or political motives. An APT occurs over a long period with a high degree of secrecy using sophisticated malware.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Algorithm attacks can track system self-reporting data, like how much energy a computer is using, and use that information to select targets or trigger false alerts. Algorithmic attacks can also disable a computer by forcing it to use memory or by overworking its central processing unit. Algorithmic attacks are more devious because they exploit designs used to improve energy savings, decrease system failures, and improve efficiencies.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Finally, the new generation of attacks involves intelligent selection of victims. In the past, attacks would select the low hanging fruit or most vulnerable victims. However, with greater attention to detection and isolation of cyberattacks, cyber criminals must be more careful. They cannot risk early detection or the cybersecurity specialists will close the gates of the castle. As a result, many of the more sophisticated attacks will only launch if the attacker can match the object signature targeted.</p>
